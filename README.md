# Project Description

## Overview

This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of static code analysis techniques. A plugin designed to assess various metrics within Java code, employing multiple analyses to gauge code quality and identify potential areas for improvement.

## Features

### Halstead Analysis
- Evaluates software complexity metrics based on program length and vocabulary.

### Code Duplication Testing
- Identifies redundant or replicated code segments.

### Fan-In and Fan-Out Evaluation
- Assesses dependencies and connections within the codebase.

### Cyclomatic Complexity Assessment
- Gauges complexity based on decision points.

### Cohesion Analysis
- Evaluates the strength of relationships among program elements.

## Tools Used

This project is primarily developed in Java and uses the Javaparser library extensively to facilitate comprehensive static code analysis.
